- What is the purpose of this?
  
  The main reason is there doesn't exist a central hub for city that shows things people often miss.
  I want this to be a city gateway hub to things like:
     - You are from Vizag? I never heard of it, tell me more.
     - I am a tourist or traveller coming to vizag first time. What is the itinerary? What should I keep in mind?
     - What are the upcoming events in city?
     - How to cultivate curiosity in kids I know?
     - How can I become child again and see city afresh?
     - What should I show when people assume there is not much to Vizag except beach?
- How can I contribute?
  
  Please raise a pull request accordingly or issue or mail at vizagit at protonmail dot com or discuss in city [discord server](https://vizagite.github.io/discord)
- I don't know how to code, How can I?
  
  Discuss with others as per above, and anyone is happy to help you translate your content accordingly
- Will I get paid?
  
  No. This is open source community project. For everyone. Always for free.
